## About:
### PenShell:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically PenShell Is Just a CLI made for python developmnet. You can create your apps and give them out to us. We will validiate athe apps and add them to the PenShell Package. Here Is A Breif overview of PenShell:
- Apps:
    - Apps Are the building blocks of penshell. Penshell is made up of lots of apps. These apps use python as their language. The apps aviliable in the pendev version (these apps are still in dvelopment) are:
        - Applister:
            - Why wouldnt someone want to know the apps there are in penshell. well, if you want to know then Applister is yours. Applister tells you how many apps are there in the version of penshell you are using. Applister is really helpful if you are looking for a app which you need. Applister sees all the apps aviliable and and tells you about them! so cool!
        - Calculator (In Development):
            - A Calculator is always nice and handy. who doesnt like calculators! They help you add, subtract, divide and multiply! a calculator is the best if you work with numbers!
        - Thats It!
- Core:
    - The Core is the thing that penshell can never run without. The core has the important stuff that helps penshell do its work. You can understand how critical it is by its name. So what does the core have? lets see:
    - PenNavigator:
        - No CLI is useful if you cant see locations! So, penshell uses PenNavigator to show you around your computer!
    - PenOS:
        - **will be coming later**
